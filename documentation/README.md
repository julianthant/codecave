## üìñ **What's Different**

This documentation has been completely reorganized to eliminate duplication and provide comprehensive coverage:

### **Before (Old Structure)**

- Multiple overlapping files on the same topics
- Scattered information across many files
- Incomplete coverage of implemented features
- Inconsistent documentation standards

### **After (New Structure)**

- **6 comprehensive guides** covering all aspects
- **Zero duplication** - each topic covered once, completely
- **Complete coverage** of all implemented backend features
- **Consistent structure** and detailed examples

## üîß **Technology Stack**

## ü§ù **Contributing to Documentation**

When updating documentation:

1. **Update the comprehensive guides** - Don't create new files
2. **Maintain consistency** with the established structure
3. **Include examples** for all instructions
4. **Add troubleshooting** for common issues
5. **Update this README** if adding new guides

## üîÑ **Migration Notes**

This documentation was consolidated from multiple smaller files on January 2025. All information from the original files has been preserved and enhanced in the new comprehensive guides.

**Old files removed:**

- `development/DEVELOPMENT-ENVIRONMENT.md` ‚Üí Consolidated into [Local Development Guide](development/LOCAL-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md)
- `infrastructure/DOCKER-INFRASTRUCTURE.md` ‚Üí Consolidated into [Docker Guide](infrastructure/DOCKER-GUIDE.md)
- `infrastructure/DOPPLER-CONFIGURATION.md` ‚Üí Consolidated into [Environment & Third-Party Setup](infrastructure/DOPPLER-AND-THIRD-PARTY-SETUP.md)
- Multiple other duplicate files
