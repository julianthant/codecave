These are follow up questions/tasks based on our lastest conversation:

1) Since we changed to getting it from the github repo, I want you to remove the files that you created that has the sole purpose to local deployment and also update files that have local deployment in there.

2) I have setted up all the github secrets. let's test the deployment. this is what i got: 
julianhein@Julians-MacBook-Pro codecave %    ssh -i ~/.ssh/codecave_deploy root@64.23.239.85 "echo 'SSH connection successful!'"
root@64.23.239.85: Permission denied (publickey).
julianhein@Julians-MacBook-Pro codecave % 

what is the problem here? dont fix anything just lay them out for me.
