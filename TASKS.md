** BEFORE YOU BEGIN **

-> For every tasks, look through the context7 mcp server for documentation to accurately build files. While you go through the file, check if it matches the documentations from context7.

-> Look through the documentation folder to get any necessary documentation. Use context7 to get the documentation or request me the needed documentation. I will provide you link or texts.

-> Create a todo for each task.

-> Do frontend checks for frontend and backend for backend and inlcude both if needd.

-> read through .cursor/rules

\*\* TASKS

-> Lets setup and run terraform.

\*\* CHECKS

** FRONTEND **

-> Go through all the files you created. Optimize them if you can. If the component can be split more into server side and client side, do it. dont have unnecessary client side components.

-> Don't use useEffect, at all. There are always better alternatives. Go through the files to see if there is useEffect being used. If they are really necessary, keey them.

-> Check through all your files and make sure they are compliant with my request. Go through them to look for runtime errors. ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK THE FILES AFTER YOU CREATE THEM FOR ERRORS.

-> Remove any unused components and imports.

** BACKEND **

-> Test locally to see if it works in development.

-> Check if the thing you implemented is configured for production.

-> Go through all the files you created and see if there are any errors. Do a comprehensive review.

-> Remove any files that are unnecessay, redundant and unused.

-> Clean up the code structure if you can.

-> Check the codescence checks and if the code you wrote are compliant.

-> Update the gitignore if necessary.

-> Check if any env files are exposed.

-> Look through the problems tab to see if there are existing problems.

\*\* BOTH

-> Create a comphensive documentation for what you just wrote in the documentation folder. Update the other documentation if needed. Remove unnecessary ones or simplify/merge existing documentations if they make sense. I mean documentation as in document for the libraries that are implemented here. I want to know how you implemented them. I want them all in documentation. I dont want what you did in the chat. I want a complete summary of your implementation everything about that in a md file like docker.md in documentation folder. Use all the documentation in the root folder and with the knowledge you have create the necesssary documentation in the documentation folder.
