Before you begin:

1) Do you know the best practices for writing nextjs code? I want this server side optimized. Add SEOs.

2) Give me a clear structure of the frontend. How will you create the folder structure? Make it clear and understandable. Add this in the fronend plan.

3) Do you have a clear vision of what the landing page will look like? If not, brainstrom through the most popular sites for communities like discord, reddit, linkedin, ect... Go to those websites and view their landing pages. How do they build the navbar, the layout, the structure. What makes these layouts successful? I want mine to be unique but also at the same time be successful like that.

4) Have you thought of the texts that will be put in each section? Does it align with the project?

5) I have uploaded documentation of the official next js in the cursor settings. Read through it for the latest nextjs version before building. 

6) Make sure your code is readable and reusable. Optimize it.

7) I want you to build the navbar and the landing page.
