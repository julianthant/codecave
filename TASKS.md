** RESPONSES ** DO CHECKS AT THE END \*\*

-> I am getting this error from vercel:

Error: Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

\*\* CHECKS

-> Go through all the files you created. Optimize them if you can. If the component can be split more into server side and client side, do it. dont have unnecessary client side components.

-> Don't use useEffect, at all. There are always better alternatives. Go through the files to see if there is useEffect being used. If they are really necessary, keey them.

-> Check through all your files and make sure they are compliant with my request. Go through them to look for runtime errors. ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK THE FILES AFTER YOU CREATE THEM FOR ERRORS.

-> Remove any unused components and imports.
